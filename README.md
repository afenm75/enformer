# Enformer
# Enformer Tutorial and Documentation:
All the code in this repository come from the https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research.git. The code pertains to _Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions_ ([Avsec et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01252-x)) published in Nature methods.

**Note**. This repository does not add any additional codes. In this repository, we document the codes. Thus, you should see this page as a Tutorial page.

Here, you can see three files:
- The [Training.ipynb](Training.ipynb) file, which has been fully prepared for training, testing, and evaluation. 
- The [Enformer.ipynb](Enformer.ipynb) file.
- The [attention_module.ipynb](attention_module.ipynb) file. 

**Note**. To run the first file properly, we need two additional files for which we have provided explanations in these two files.

We recommend starting by reading the [Training.ipynb](Training.ipynb), then go for [Enformer.ipynb](Enformer.ipynb) and [attention_module.ipynb](attention_module.ipynb) and finally, take a look at [Enformer_Enhancer_Results](Enformer_Enhancer_Results.ipynb). Reading these files, along with the written reports, helps readers with some levele of knowledge in bioinformatics find valuable insights about Enformers.

**Note** To rerun the file please download the data, and upload them to your Google Colab account, then go to tag Runtime -> Change runtime type -> choose GPU
