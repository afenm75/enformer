# Enformer Documentation:
These codes are all come from the https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research.git in detail the paper Effective gene expression prediction from sequence by integrating long-range interactions
Å½iga Avsec at nature method 2021.
This page haven't added any additional codes.
All code written by the author GitHub page mentioned above.
Here the codes are documented, you should see this page as a Tutorial page.
we recommend that first read Training file then go for Enformer and attention:_module and lastly take a look at enformer_enhancer_Results
Reading these files, along with the written reports, helps readers with some levele of knowledge in bioinformatics find valuable insights about Enformers.

Here, you can see three files. First, the "training.ipynb" file, which has been fully prepared for training, testing, and evaluation. Second, the "enformer.ipynb" file, and third, the "attention-module.ipynb" file. To run the first file properly, we need two additional files for which we have provided explanations in these two files.
